A. 
Ensemble Learning :
Sum of the many ml model to one model  [this model are diffrent]
    m1(desicison tree) + m2(linear) + m3(logistic)

or 

Sum of the many ml model to one model [this model are same but diffrent data]
    m1(data1) + m2(data2) +m3(data3)    "this ml model(linear) are same"


From this the majority count will be applyied : {3-> 0 , 2 -> 1} so the value will predicted as 0 



B.
Types of Ensemble Learning -> 
    1. Voting 
    2. Bagging  -> Random Forest
    3. Boosting  -> Adaboost , Gradient Boosting , XgBoost 
    4. stacking


Note : If the it is classification then it will voting count and the regression is there then the mean will be calculated  

🧑‍💻 Voting : Base models are diffrent from each other. 

                    data
            |----------|----------|     
           SVM        LOR         DT
            \          |          /
                      KNN       


🧑‍💻 Stacking : Same thing as above one but the major changes """ Extra weight is given to the diffrent model """.

🧑‍💻 Bagging : Boostrapped Aggregation 

                     Data 
            /          |           \
            D1        D2          D3
            |----------|----------|     
           SVM        SVM         SVM


Generally the ML model are desicison tree and that makes up the Random Forest 

🧑‍💻 Boosting trains multiple SVM models sequentially, with each model focusing on correcting the errors of the previous models.

Data -> SVM -> SVM -> SVM -> Output
